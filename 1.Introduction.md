## Introduction
### Mathematical Formulation
- x is the vector of variables, also called unknowns or parameters;
- f is the objective function, a (scalar) function of x that we want to maximize or
minimize;
- $c_{i}$ are constraint functions, which are scalar functions of x that define certain equations
and inequalities that the unknown vector x must satisfy.

$$ \min_{x \in R^{n}} f(x) \qquad subject \ to \quad c_{i}(x)=0, \ i \in \varepsilon \qquad  \qquad \qquad    \\\  c_{i}(x)\ge0,\ i\in\iota     $$    

#### Constrained and Unconstrained Optimization
#### Global an Local Optimization
#### Stochastic and Deterministic Optimization
#### Convexity

$ \qquad f(\alpha x \ + \ (1-\alpha)y)\le \alpha f(x) \ + (1-\alpha)f(y)  \quad for \ all \ \alpha \in [0,1] $
#### Optimization Algorithms
- Robustness. They should perform well on a wide variety of problems in their class, for all reasonable values of the starting point.
- Efficiency. They should not require excessive computer time or storage.
- Accuracy. They should be able to identify a solution with precision, without being overly sensitive to errors in the data or to the arithmetic rounding errors that occur
when the algorithm is implemented on a computer.
